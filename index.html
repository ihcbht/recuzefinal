          <h3>Recycle and Reuse.</h3>
          <p>Good quality clothing is sent to charity institutions and is used as second hand clothing. Unwearable textiles are considered as damaged textiles, and are processed in the factory as rags. Rags are collected and sent to the wiping and flocking industry. Other materials will be sent for fibre reclamation and stuffing. Fibres from the old fabrics are reclaimed and are used for making new garments. Threads from the fabric is pulled out and used for re-weaving new garments or blankets.</p>
